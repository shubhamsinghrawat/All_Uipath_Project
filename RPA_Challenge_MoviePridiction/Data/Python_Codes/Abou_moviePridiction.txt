Glad to let you all know that I have completed RPA challenge of predicting movie reviews in just 12 seconds with high accuracy. 
Steps that bot performs
1. Navigate to RPA challenge website (link https://lnkd.in/d_ra6BB) 
2. Select random top 3 movies and read each reviews. 
3. Predict if review is positive or negative with the help of #AI model. 
4. After predicting review from AI model, #javascript is used to click  on positive or negative button respectively.
5. All application and business error handled by bot #uipath

Scope Of Improvement: Accuracy of AI Model can be improved.
